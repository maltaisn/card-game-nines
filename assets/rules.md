# ![](icon-cards) Nines
Nines is a trick-taking card game with 3 players played with a standard
deck of 52 cards. The object of the game is to lower your score to zero
by taking as many tricks as possible.

The order of the cards goes from the 2 (the weakest), to the Ace (the
strongest). The cards in the trump suit are stronger than the other
cards.


# ![](icon-cards) Playing
All of the cards are dealt into four hands of thirteen cards. One hand
for each player and the remaining hand is set aside.

After all the cards are dealt, each player can look at his hand and
decide if he wants to trade it for the extra hand. The dealer has the
first choice of taking the hand. Then, the choice moves to the left
until everyone has decided. Players may take the hand that someone else
has already traded in.

The object of the game is to take as many tricks as possible. The trump
suit goes in the following sequence: Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs,
No Trump.

Play starts with the player to the left of the dealer and always moves
to the left around the table. The player who plays the highest card of
the suit that was led is awarded the trick. Each player must follow suit
if they can. If they are out of the suit that was led, they can either
play a card from another suit (not the trump suit) and forfeit the
trick, or they can play a trump card which will earn them the trick,
provided nobody plays a higher trump. Play continues until 13 tricks are
played, at which point all players will be out of cards.

## The No Trump Hand
After the four trump hands, there is a hand that is played without
trump. In this round, the tricks always go to the person who played the
highest card of the same suit that was led, since there is no trump
suit.


# ![](icon-book) Scoring
All players start the game with a score of nine, and the object is to
bring one's score to zero or lower. Ties are broken by playing
additional rounds.

In each hand, the number of tricks a player has collected translates to
the change that will happen to their score. If four tricks are
collected, the score will remain the same. For each trick there is in
excess of four, the player's score will go down by one. For each trick
shy of four, the player's score will go up by one. So, three tricks will
result in a score increase of one, six tricks will result in a score
decrease of two.
